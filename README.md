## Buck-Converter
The Buck Converter is used in SMPS circuits where the DC output voltage needs to be lower than the DC input voltage. 
The DC input can be derived from rectified AC or from any DC supply. 
It is useful where electrical isolation is not needed between the switching circuit and the output,
but where the input is from a rectified AC source, isolation between the AC source and the rectifier could be provided by a mains isolating transformer.

## Boost-Converter
A boost converter is one of the simplest types of switch mode converter. 
As the name suggests, it takes an input voltage and boosts or increases it. All it consists of is an inductor, a semiconductor switch (these days itâ€™s a MOSFET, since you can get really nice ones these days),
a diode and a capacitor. Also needed is a source of a periodic square wave. This can be something as simple as a 555 timer or even a dedicated SMPS IC like the famous MC34063A IC.

## Buck-Boost-Converter
It is a type of DC to DC converter and it has a magnitude of output voltage. It may be more or less than equal to the input voltage magnitude. 
The buck boost converter is equal to the fly back circuit and single inductor is used in the place of the transformer. There are two types of converters in the buck boost converter that are buck converter and the other one is boost converter. 
These converters can produce the range of output voltage than the input voltage.
